 \section{Overview}\label{index_Overview}
The Simple \doxyref{Mesh}{p.}{classMesh} Library is a free c++ library to manipulate meshes. It uses a half edge representation of a mesh. It is based on the GMTools library, which was written by Dimitri Kudelski using the C programation langage.

This deposit contains the source code, some examples applications with the corresponding source code and the documentation of the library.

\begin{Desc}
\item[Warning:]YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE OPENGL AND THE GLUT LIBRARIES TO USE THIS LIBRARY OR LAUNCH A PRE-COMPILED APP. 

IF YOU DO NOT, PLEASE INSTALL IT OR COMMENT THE PART OF THE CODE THAT USES THEESE LIBRARIES - TYPICALLY THE DISPLAY METHODS - 

THEN RECOMPILE THE CODE AND USE IT ON YOUR OWN WAY.\end{Desc}
\section{Architecture}\label{index_Architecture}
You will find two main directories in this library :\begin{itemize}
\item The src directory.\item The inc directory.\item The bin directory.\item The examples directory.\end{itemize}


The first one contains all the source code files while the second one contains only the headers. The third contains a set of simple executable software. Finally the fourth one contains the source code of each executable in the bin directory. The code is documented in this section and tries to help beginers to familiarisate themselves with the library.

This library is coded in c++ on the base of the GMTools library developed
by Dimitri Kudelski.

You need to have the OpenGL and the glut libraries to use the SML one.

If you don't have them, please install them or comment the parts of the
source code containing references to these libraries functions
(mainly the display functions and the window management functions) and
recompile the library. Then use it on your own way.
